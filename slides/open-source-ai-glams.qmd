# Part 1: What and Why?


## What is Open Source AI?

- AI systems where key components are publicly accessible
- A spectrum: from "open weights" to fully open training pipelines
- Growing ecosystem of models, tools, and communities

::: {.notes}
- Open source AI isn't binary - there's a spectrum of openness
- We'll explore what "open" means in practice
:::

# What can Libraries do with AI?

## The Chat Interface?

![](assets/quickfix.jpg)

::: {.notes}
- As I already mentioned in my intro, Generative AI has become the dominant way of thinking about AI
- In particular, the "chat interface" i.e. chat GPT, claude etc, are the dominant way in which many people (consciously) interact with AI
- this sometimes leads to the default answer to "what can we do with AI" to be "How can we create a chat interface for our collection?"

:::


## The Default Answer

"Let's build a chatbot for our collections!" 

::: {.fragment}
But is this the best starting point?

## AI: Ferrari vs Honda Civic

> "A frontier model like GPT-4 is like a Ferrari. It's an obvious triumph of engineering, designed to win races. But it takes a special pit crew just to change the tires.

> In contrast, a smaller specialized model is like a Honda Civic. It's engineered to be affordable, reliable, and extremely useful. And that's why they're absolutely everywhere."

# What Makes AI Open?

- Open weights vs closed weights
- Open weights vs open source? 
- Open data?
  

## What is an AI Model?

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    W[Weights<br/>Learned numbers] --> M((Model))
    C[Code<br/>Instructions] --> M
    M --> T[Does tasks]
```

The **weights** are the "brain" - patterns learned from training data

## What Are Weights?

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    D[(Training Data<br/>Books, websites, images)] --> L[Learning Process]
    L --> W[Weights File<br/>.safetensors]
    W --> E["Billions of numbers:<br/>[0.023, -0.891, 0.442, ...]"]
```

These numbers encode everything the model "knows"

## Open vs Closed Weights

**Closed Weights**

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    A[API only] --> B[Black box]
    B --> V[Vendor controlled]
```
:::

## Open Source (Beyond Weights)

"fully" open source AI includes:

- **Training code**: How the model was built
- **Training data**: What the model learned from
- **Evaluation details**: How performance was measured

**Examples of "fully" open models:**

- [OLMo](https://allenai.org/olmo) - Allen AI's fully open LLM
- [SmolLM](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B) - Hugging Face's small, efficient models


## Why Open?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Choice** | 1M+ models vs ~100 closed APIs |
| **Control** | Run where you want, pin versions |
| **Flexibility** | Fine-tune for your domain |
| **Cost** | Often cheaper at scale |
| **Privacy** | Data never leaves your infra |
| **Transparency** | Inspect model & training data |

# Part 2: How?

## Choosing a Model

**AI/ML is more than LLMs!**

Many tasks don't need a large language model:

- **Classification**: Categorize documents, detect languages
- **Embeddings**: Semantic search, similarity matching
- **Vision**: OCR, image classification, object detection
- **Structured extraction**: Named entities, dates, metadata

**Finding models**: [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) - 1M+ open models, filterable by task, language, size



## Running the model 

Open models != local models 

A few genres of inference for open models:

- Pay per token via a hosted endpoint "serverless"
- Run the model on your own hardware (laptop, desktop, server)
- Rent the hardware to run the model and pay per hour

## Tradeoffs

| Approach | Setup | Best For |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Pay per token | Minimal | Prototyping, low volume |
| Local hardware | Medium | Privacy, offline use |
| Rent hardware | Higher | Production, scale |

## Pay Per Token (Serverless)

**Setup**: Minimal - use via OpenAI-compatible client

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pros**

- Quick to start
- No hardware needed
- Competitive pricing
- Easy model switching
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Cons**

- Vendor dependency
- Results can vary across providers
- Ongoing costs
- Data leaves your infrastructure
:::
:::

## Local Hardware

**Setup**: Medium - install runtime + download model

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pros**

- Full control
- Data stays local
- No ongoing costs
- Works offline
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Cons**

- Hardware limitations
- Model size constraints
- Setup/maintenance
- Updates are manual
:::
:::

## Rent Hardware (Dedicated)

**Setup**: Higher - configure cloud instance

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pros**

- Scalable resources
- Run any model size
- Dedicated capacity
- Production-ready
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Cons**

- Costs scale with usage
- Infrastructure complexity
- Requires DevOps skills
- Cold start times

How can GLAMs contribute to Open Source AI?


## Contributing: Datasets

GLAMs hold unique assets for AI training:

- **Curated collections**: High-quality, well-documented data
- **Domain expertise**: Historical texts, scientific literature, archival materials
- **Linguistic diversity**: Multilingual and underrepresented language resources
- **Rich metadata**: Structured information often missing from web scrapes

## Contributing: Evaluations

Move beyond "vibe checks" with domain expertise:

- **Task benchmarks**: Cataloging, transcription, metadata extraction
- **Quality assessment**: Expert evaluation of model outputs
- **Edge cases**: Cultural heritage contexts models often get wrong
- **Bias detection**: Identifying gaps in historical & cultural knowledge

## Contributing: Models

Share trained models back to the community:

- **Fine-tuned models**: Adapt general models to your domain (historical texts, scientific literature)
- **Specialized task models**: OCR for historical typefaces, metadata extraction, document classification
- **Embedding models**: Better semantic search using domain-specific vocabularies
