Hi, I'm Daniel. I'm a librarian interested in using computational methods to do research with library and archive collections. I'm particularly excited by the possibilities of using deep-learning both as part of the "day-to-day" processes within a library setting and for enabling new kinds of research. 

I currently work at the British Library as a Digital Curator for the [Living with Machines](https://github.com/living-with-machines) project.
