Hi, I'm Daniel. I'm a Machine Learning Librarian at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).

I am interested in how ideas from library science can inform a healthy machine-learning ecosystem and how machine learning can support the work of galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM). 

Some projects I am/have been involved in:

- [BigLAM](https://huggingface.co/biglam): an initiative to make GLAM datasets with machine learning datasets more widely available. 
- [ai4lam](https://ai4lam.org/): an international, participatory community focused on advancing the use of artificial intelligence in, for and by libraries, archives and museums. 
- [LivingwithMachines](https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/) a research collobaration between the [British Library](https://www.bl.uk/) and the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) focused on applying data science and machine learning methods to digitised historical collections.
