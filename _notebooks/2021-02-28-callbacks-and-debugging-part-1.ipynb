In particular I try and record my though process and the steps I took. This probably makes for an unreadable mess but I thought it might be useful as a record for myself. \n",

    "> a model component with different portions of the training examples and print the accuracy figures and accuracy improvements with more data. This recipe takes pretty much the same arguments as train. --n-samples sets the number of sample models to train at different stages. For instance, 10 will train models for 10% of the examples, 20%, 30% and so on. This recipe is useful to determine the quality of the collected annotations, and whether more training examples will improve the accuracy. As a rule of thumb, if accuracy improves within the last 25%, training with more examples will likely result in better accuracy. [Source](https://prodi.gy/docs/recipes#train-curve) \n",
