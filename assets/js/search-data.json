            "content": "tl;dr . This post covers: . the motivations for &#39;pragmatic hyperparameters optimization&#39; | how to do this using Optuna (with an example applied to the fastai2 library) | . Optimizing hyperparameters? . Deep learning models have a range of Hyperparameters. These include the basic building blocks of a model like the number of layers used or the size of embedding layers, and the parameters for the training of models such as learning rate. Changing some of these parameters will improve the performance of a model. There is therefore a potential win from finding the right values for these parameters. . Auto ML vs pragmatic hyperparameters optimization . As a way of framing &#39;pragmatic search&#39;, it is useful to contrast it to Auto ML. If you haven&#39;t come across it before: . The term AutoML has traditionally been used to describe automated methods for model selection and/or hyperparameter optimization. - 1. . In particular what is termed Auto ML often includes a search across model and Hyperparameters but can also refer to &#39;Neural Architecture Search&#39; in which the objective is to piece together a new model type for a specific problem or dataset. An underlying assumption of some of this Auto ML approach is that each problem or dataset requires a unique model architecture. . In contrast a more &#39;pragmatic&#39; approach uses an existing model architectures which have been shown to work across a range of datasets and tasks, and utilise transfer learning and other &#39;tricks&#39; like cyclical learning rates and data augmentation. In a heritage context, it is likely that there are going to be bigger issues with imbalanced classes, noisy labels etc, and focusing on designing a custom architecture is probably going to lead to modest improvements in the performance of the model. . So what remains to be optimized? . In contrast to Auto ML which can involve looking at huge range of potential architectures and parameters we could instead limit our focus to smaller set of things which may have a large impact on the performance of your model. . As an example use case for hyperparameters optimization I&#39;ll use two datasets which contain transcripts of trials from the Old Bailey online and which are classified into various categories (theft, deception, etc). One of the datasets is drawn the decade 1830 the other one 1730. The approach taken to classifying these trials will be to follow the &quot;Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification&quot; approach. 2. . I won&#39;t give an in depth summary of the approach here but idea is that: . A language model - in this case a LSTM based model - is trained on a Wikipedia text. This provides a &quot;general&quot; language model that learns to &quot;understand&quot; general features of a language, in this case English | this language model is then fine-tuned on a target dataset, in the orginal paper this is IMDB movie reviews. | one this language model has been fine-tuned on the target dataset this fine-tuned language model is used as input for a classifier | . The intuition here is that by utilising a pre-trained language model the Wikipedia part, and the fine-tuning part we get the benefits of a massive training set (Wikipedia) whilst also being able to &#39;focus&#39; the language model on a target corpus which will use language differently. This makes a lot of intuitive sense, but a question in this use case is how much to fine-tune the language model on our target datasets. A reasonable assumption might be that since language will be more different in 1730 compared to 1830 we may want to fine tune the language model trained on Wikipedia more on the 1730 dataset. . We could of course test through some trial and error experiments, but this is a question which may benefit from some more systematic searching for appropriate hyperparameters. Before we get into this example in more depth I&#39;ll discuss the library I&#39;m working with for doing this hyperparameter searching. . Optuna: A hyperparameter optimization framework . In this post I will be using Optuna &quot;an automatic hyperparameter optimization software framework, particularly designed for machine learning&quot;. 3. . There are some really nice features in Optuna which I&#39;ll cover in this post as I explore the question of language model fine-tuning, so hopefully even if you don&#39;t care about the specific use case it might still provide a useful overview of Optuna. . In this blog post my examples will use version two of the fastai library but there really isn&#39;t anything that won&#39;t translate to other frameworks. Optuna has integrations for a number of libraries (including version 1 of fastai) but for this blog I won&#39;t use this integration. . A simple optimization example . To show the approach used in Optuna I&#39;ll use a simple image classification example. In this case using a toy example of classifying people vs cats in images taken from 19th Century books. . Optuna has two main concepts to understand: study and trial. A study is the overarching process of optimization based on some objective function. A trial is a single test/execution of the objective function. We&#39;ll return to this in more detail. For now lets look at a simple example. . For our first example we&#39;ll just use Optuna to test whether to use a pre-trained model or not. If the option is True then the ResNet18 model we use will use weights from pre-training on ImageNet, if False the model will start with random weights. . Looking at the high level steps of using Optuna (I&#39;ll go into more detail later). We create an objective function: . !wget -q https://zenodo.org/record/3689444/files/humancats.zip?download=1 !unzip -q *humancats.zip* -d data/ . . def objective(trial): is_pretrained = trial.suggest_categorical(&#39;pre_trained&#39;, [True, False]) dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(&#39;data/human_vs_cats/&#39;, valid_pct=0.4, item_tfms=Resize(64)) learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, pretrained=is_pretrained, metrics=[accuracy]) learn.fit(1) acc = learn.recorder.values[-1][-1] return acc . Most of this will look familiar if you are have used fastai before. Once we have this we create a study: . study = optuna.create_study(direction=&#39;maximize&#39;) . and then optimize this study: . study.optimize(objective, n_trials=2) . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy time . 0 | 1.503035 | 0.710954 | 0.555556 | 00:06 | . [I 2020-06-04 16:58:49,862] Finished trial#0 with value: 0.5555555820465088 with parameters: {&#39;pre_trained&#39;: False}. Best is trial#0 with value: 0.5555555820465088. . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy time . 0 | 1.691165 | 1.218440 | 0.555556 | 00:05 | . [I 2020-06-04 16:58:56,272] Finished trial#1 with value: 0.5555555820465088 with parameters: {&#39;pre_trained&#39;: False}. Best is trial#0 with value: 0.5555555820465088. . Once we&#39;ve run some trials we can inspect the study object for the best value we&#39;re optimizing for. In this case this is the accuracy but it will be whatever is returned by our function. We can also see the parameters which led to this value. . study.best_value, study.best_params . (0.5555555820465088, {&#39;pre_trained&#39;: False}) . This toy example wasn&#39;t particularly useful (it just confirmed we probably want to use a pre-trained model) but going through the steps provides an overview of the main things required by Optuna. Starting with defining a function objective . def objective(trial): . this is the function we want to optimize. We could call it something else but following the convention in the Optuna docs the function we&#39;ll call it objective. This function takes &#39;trial&#39; as an argument. . is_pretrained = trial.suggest_categorical(&#39;pre_trained&#39;, [True, False]) . here we use trial to &quot;suggest&quot; a categorical in this case one of two options (whether pre trained is set to true or false). We do this using trial.suggest_categorical and pass it the potential options (in this case True or False). . trial.suggest_blah defines the paramater &quot;search space&quot; for Optuna. We&#39;ll look at all of the options for this later on. The final step in defining our objective function i.e. the thing we want to optimize: . return acc . This return value is objective value that Optuna will optimize. Because this is just the return value of a function there is a lot of flexibility in what this can be. In this example it is accuracy but it could be training or validation loss, or another training metrics. Later on we&#39;ll look at this in more detail. . Now let&#39;s look at the study part: . study = optuna.create_study(direction=&#39;maximize&#39;) . This is the most simple way of creating a study. This creates a study object, again, we&#39;ll look at more options as we go along. The one option we pass here is the direction. This refers to to whether Optuna should try to increase the return value of our optimization function or decrease it. This depends on what you a tracking i.e. you&#39;d want to minimize error or validation loss but increase accuracy or F1 score. . Looking at the overview provided in the Optuna docs we have three main building blocks: . Trial: A single call of the objective function . | Study: An optimization session, which is a set of trials . | Parameter: A variable whose value is to be optimized . | . Parameter search space . Borrowing once more from the docs: . The difficulty of optimization increases roughly exponentially with regard to the number of parameters. That is, the number of necessary trials increases exponentially when you increase the number of parameters, so it is recommended to not add unimportant parameters . This is a crucial point. Particularly if we want to use optimization in a pragmatic way. When we have existing knowledge or evidence about what works well for a particular problem, we should use that rather than asking Optuna to find this out for us. There are some extra tricks to make our search for the best parameters more efficient which will be explored below but for now let&#39;s get back to the example use case. . Fine-tuning a language model . df_1830 = pd.read_csv(&#39;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/davanstrien/4bc85d8a4127a2791732280ffaa43293/raw/cd1a3cc53674b64c8f130edbcb34e835afa665fb/1830trial.csv&#39;) df_1730 = pd.read_csv(&#39;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/davanstrien/4bc85d8a4127a2791732280ffaa43293/raw/cd1a3cc53674b64c8f130edbcb34e835afa665fb/1730trial.csv&#39;) . .

We load the data using fastai2 TextDataLoaders . def load_lm_data(df): data_lm = TextDataLoaders.from_df( df.sample(frac=0.5), text_col=&quot;text&quot;, is_lm=True, bs=128 ) return data_lm # Classification data def load_class_data(df, data_lm): data_class = TextDataLoaders.from_df( df.sample(frac=0.5), text_col=&quot;text&quot;, label_col=&quot;broad&quot;, valid_pct=0.3, bs=128, text_vocab=data_lm.vocab, ) return data_class . . data_lm = load_lm_data(df_1830) data_class = load_class_data(df_1830, data_lm) .

Optuna trial suggest . In the example above trial.suggest_categorical was used to define the potential parameter. Optuna has five kinds of parameters which can be optimized. These all work through the trial.suggest method. . Categorical . This can be used for models, optimizers, and for True/False flags. . optimizer = trial.suggest_categorical(&#39;optimizer&#39;, [&#39;MomentumSGD&#39;, &#39;Adam&#39;]) .

Loguniform . learning_rate = trial.suggest_loguniform(&#39;learning_rate&#39;, 1e-4, 1e-2) . Discrete-uniform . drop_path_rate = trial.suggest_discrete_uniform(&#39;drop_path_rate&#39;, 0.0, 1.0) . The string value provides a key for the parameters which is used to access these parameters later, it&#39;s therefore important to give them a sensible name. . Limiting parameters? . Adding additional trial.suggest to your optimization function increases the search space for Optuna to optimize over so you should avoid adding additional parameters if they are not necessary. . The other way in which the search space can be constrained is to limit the range of the search i.e. for learning rate . learning_rate = trial.suggest_loguniform(&#39;learning_rate&#39;, 1e-4, 1e-2) . is preferable over . learning_rate = trial.suggest_loguniform(&#39;learning_rate&#39;, 1e-10, 1e-1) . if it&#39;s not likely the optimal learning rate will sit outside of this range. . How many parameters you include will also depend on the type of model you are trying to train. In the use case of fine-tuning a language model we will want to limit the options more since language models are generally quite slow to train. If, on the other hand, we were trying to improve an image classification model which only takes minutes to train then searching through a larger parameter space would become more feasible. . Objective function for fine-tuning a language model . The objective function below has two stages; train a language model, use the encoder from this language model for a classifier. . The parameters we&#39;re trying to optimize in this case are: . learning rate for the frozen language model | number of epochs to train only the final layers of the language model | learning rate for the unfrozen language model | number of epochs for training the whole language model | . We use lm_learn.no_bar() as a context manager to reduce the amount of logging. . def objective(trial): lm_learn = create_lm() lr_frozen = trial.suggest_loguniform(&quot;learning_rate_frozen&quot;, 1e-4, 1e-1) head_epochs = trial.suggest_int(&quot;head_epochs&quot;, 1, 5) with lm_learn.no_bar(): lm_learn.fit_one_cycle(head_epochs, lr_max=lr_frozen) # Unfrozen Language model lr_unfreeze = trial.suggest_loguniform(&quot;learning_rate_unfrozen&quot;, 1e-7, 1e-1) body_epochs = trial.suggest_int(&quot;lm_body_epochs&quot;, 1, 5) lm_learn.unfreeze() with lm_learn.no_bar(): lm_learn.fit_one_cycle(body_epochs, lr_unfreeze) lm_learn.save_encoder(&quot;finetuned&quot;) # Classification cl_learn = create_class_learn() cl_learn.load_encoder(&quot;finetuned&quot;) cl_learn.fit_one_cycle(3) f1 = cl_learn.recorder.values[-1][-1] return f1 .

Where to start the search? . As I mentioned at the start I think it&#39;s worth trying to think pragmatically about how to use hyper-parameter optimizations. I already mentioned limiting the number of parameters and limiting the potential options in these parameters. However we can also intervene more directly in how Optuna runs a trial. . Suggesting a learning rate . One of the yummiest features in fastai which has also made it into other deep-learning libraries is the learning rate finer lr_find(). As a reminder: . the LR Finder trains the model with exp onentially growing learning rates from start_lr to end_lr for num_it and stops in case of divergence (unless stop_div=False) then plots the losses vs the learning rates with a log scale. . Since the Learning rate finder often gives a good learning rate we should see if we can use this as a starting point for our trials. . Enqueue trial . Using enqueue_trial you can queue up trials with specied paramters. This can be for all of the parameters or just a subset. We can use lr_find to suggest a learning rate for the language model and then que a trial with this learning rate. . lm_learn = create_lm() lm_learn.unfreeze() . lr_min,lr_steep = lm_learn.lr_find(suggestions=True) . lr_min, lr_steep .

Best is trial#3 with value: 0.6866621960133127. . Using the learning rate from the LR_finder gives us our best trial so far. This is likely to be because learning rate is a particularly important hyper-parameter. The suggested learning rate from lr_find may not always be the best but using either the suggested one or picking one based on the plot as a starting point for the trial may help Optuna to start from sensible starting point while still giving the freedom for optuna to diverge away from this in later trials if helps the objective function. . Pruning trials . The next feature of Optuna which helps make parameter searching more efficient is pruning. Pruning is a process for stopping bad trials early. . For example if we have the following three trials: . Trial 1 - epoch 1: 87% accuracy | Trial 2 - epoch 1: 85% accuracy | Trial 3 - epoch 1: 60% accuracy | . probably it&#39;s not worth continuing with trial 3. Pruning trials helps focus computational resources on trials which are likely to improve on previous trials. The likely here is important. It is possible that some trials may be pruned early which actually would have done better in the end. Optuna offers a number of different pruning algorithms, I won&#39;t cover these here but the documentation gives a good overview and includes links to the papers which propose the implemented pruning algorithms. . How to do pruning in Optuna? . Optuna has intergrations with various machine learning libraries. These intergrations can help with the pruning but setting up pruning manually is also pretty straight forward to do. . The two things we need to do is report the value and the stage in the training porcess: . trial.report(metric, step) . then we call: . if trial.should_prune(): raise optuna.exceptions.TrialPruned() . Depending on your objective function this will be put in different places. In the example of fine-tuning the language model, because we&#39;re trying to optimize the classification part it, it means the pruning step can only be called quite late in the traing loop. Ideally it would be called earlier but we still save a little bit of time on unpromising trials. . The new objective function with pruning: . def objective(trial): lm_learn = create_lm() lr_frozen = trial.suggest_loguniform(&quot;learning_rate_frozen&quot;, 1e-4, 1e-1) head_epochs = trial.suggest_int(&quot;head_epochs&quot;, 1, 5) with lm_learn.no_bar(): lm_learn.fit_one_cycle(head_epochs, lr_max=lr_frozen) # Unfrozen Language model lr_unfreeze = trial.suggest_loguniform(&quot;learning_rate_unfrozen&quot;, 1e-7, 1e-1) body_epochs = trial.suggest_int(&quot;lm_body_epochs&quot;, 1, 5) lm_learn.unfreeze() with lm_learn.no_bar(): lm_learn.fit_one_cycle(body_epochs, lr_unfreeze) lm_learn.save_encoder(&quot;finetuned&quot;) # Classification cl_learn = create_class_learn() cl_learn.load_encoder(&quot;finetuned&quot;) for step in range(3): cl_learn.fit(1) # Pruning intermediate_f1 = cl_learn.recorder.values[-1][ -1 ] # get f1 score for current step trial.report(intermediate_f1, step) # report f1 if trial.should_prune(): # let optuna decide whether to prune raise optuna.exceptions.TrialPruned() f1 = cl_learn.recorder.values[-1][-1] return f1 .

We can also see which was the best trial. . study.best_trial.number . 2 . The number of trials run depends mainly on how long your model takes to train, the size of the paramter search space and your patience. If trials are failing to improve better scores for a long time it&#39;s probably better to actively think about how to improve your approach to the problem (better data, more data, chaning model design etc.) rather than hoping hyperaparmet tuning will fix the problem. .

This can be useful for getting a sense of how trials progress and also help give a sense of whether some trials are being pruned prematurely . optuna.visualization.plot_intermediate_values(study1830) . . . plot_parallel_coordinate plots parameters choices in relation to values.

These are broadly similar although learning rate frozen/unfrozen are in different places for the 1730 and 1830 trials. . Multi objective . Optuna has experimental support for multi-objective optimization. This might be useful if you don&#39;t want to optimize for only one metrics. . An alternative to using this approach is to report other things you care about during the trial but don&#39;t directly want to optimize for. As an example, you might mostly care about the accuracy of a model but also care a bit about how long it takes to do inference. . One approach is to use a multi-objective trial. An alternative is to instead log inference time as part of the trial and continue to optimize for other metrics. You can then later on balance the accuracy of different trials with the inference time. It may turn out later that a slightly slower inference time can be dealt with by scaling vertically. Not prematurely optimizing for multi-objectives can therefore give you more flexibility. To show this in practice I&#39;ll use an image classification dataset. . The data . The data is images of maps and other things from historic newspapers. The aim is to classify whether the image is a map or something else. . dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder( &quot;data/1905_maps/&quot;, valid_pct=0.3, item_tfms=Resize(256) ) dls.show_batch() . learn.unfreeze() lr_min,unfrozen_lr_steep = learn.lr_find(suggestions=True) . Excessive model parameter search . Since the time to train the model is more reasonable we can add a more parameters to the search space. In practice this is pretty overkill but is useful as an example of working with the outputs of trials with many parameters. . def objective(trial): apply_tfms = trial.suggest_categorical(&quot;apply_tfms&quot;, [True, False]) if apply_tfms: aug_tfms = aug_transforms( mult=trial.suggest_uniform(&quot;mult&quot;, 0.0, 1.0), do_flip=trial.suggest_categorical(&quot;do_flip&quot;, [True, False]), flip_vert=trial.suggest_categorical(&quot;flip_vert&quot;, [True, False]), max_rotate=trial.suggest_uniform(&quot;max_rotate&quot;, 0, 180), max_zoom=trial.suggest_uniform(&quot;max_zoom&quot;, 0, 3.0), max_lighting=trial.suggest_uniform(&quot;max_lighting&quot;, 0.0, 1.0), ) else: aug_tfms = None dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder( &quot;data/1905_maps/&quot;, valid_pct=0.3, item_tfms=Resize(256), aug_transforms=aug_tfms ) model = trial.suggest_categorical( &quot;model&quot;, [&quot;resnet18&quot;, &quot;resnet50&quot;, &quot;xresnet50&quot;, &quot;squeezenet1_0&quot;, &quot;densenet121&quot;] ) learn = cnn_learner( dls, arch=eval(model), pretrained=True, metrics=[F1Score(average=&quot;weighted&quot;)] ).to_fp16() epochs = trial.suggest_int(&quot;epochs&quot;, 1, 10) for step in range(epochs): with learn.no_bar(): learn.fit_one_cycle( 1, base_lr=trial.suggest_loguniform(&quot;learning_rate&quot;, 1e-5, 1e-1) ) unfrozen_epochs = trial.suggest_int(&quot;unfrozen_epochs&quot;, 1, 10) unfrozen_lr = trial.suggest_loguniform(&quot;unfrozen_learning_rate&quot;, 1e-10, 1e-1) learn.unfreeze() for step in range(unfrozen_epochs): with learn.no_bar(): learn.fit_one_cycle(1, lr_max=unfrozen_lr) int_f1 = learn.recorder.values[-1][-1] trial.report(int_f1, step) if trial.should_prune(): raise optuna.exceptions.TrialPruned() t0 = time.time() learn.validate() t1 = time.time() execute_time = t1 - t0 trial.set_user_attr(&quot;execute_time&quot;, execute_time) f1 = learn.recorder.values[-1][-1] return f1 .

            "title": "Multi-model metadata generation",
            "content": "Learning from multiple input types . Deep learning models usually take one type of input (image, text etc.) to predict output labels (category, entities etc). This usually makes sense if the data you are using to make predictions contains a lot of information. i.e. a chunk of text from a movie review or an image. . Recently I have been playing around with a Website Classification Dataset from the UK web archive. The dataset is derived from a manually curated web archive which contains a primary and secondary category for each web page. The UK web archive has made a dataset available based on this archive which contains the manually classified subject categories alongside the page URL and the page title. . As part of playing around with this dataset I was keen to see if a multi-input model would work well. In this case exploring a model that takes both text and tabular data as input. A preview of the data: . Primary Category Secondary Category Title URL . 0 Arts &amp; Humanities | Architecture | 68 Dean Street | http://www.sixty8.com/ | . 1 Arts &amp; Humanities | Architecture | Abandoned Communities | http://www.abandonedcommunities.co.uk/ | . 2 Arts &amp; Humanities | Architecture | Alexander Thomson Society | http://www.greekthomson.com/ | . 3 Arts &amp; Humanities | Architecture | Arab British Centre, The | http://www.arabbritishcentre.org.uk/ | . 4 Arts &amp; Humanities | Architecture | Architectural Association School of Architecture | http://www.aaschool.ac.uk/ | . Based on this data the UK web archive are interested: . &quot;in understanding whether high-level metadata like this can be used to train an appropriate automatic classification system so that we might use this manually generated dataset to partially automate the categorisation of our larger archives.&quot; . This is going to be fairly tricky but offers a nice excuse to try to use models with multiple inputs to predict our categories. . Looking at the data . Taking a closer look at the data: . Unique primary categories . len(df[&#39;Primary Category&#39;].unique()) . 24 . Unique secondary categories . len(df[&#39;Secondary Category&#39;].unique()) . 104 . Predicting a 104 different labels is going to be pretty difficult so I&#39;ve only used &#39;Primary Category&#39; as the the y target. What is the distribution of these categories like? .

I could drop some of rows which don&#39;t occur often but since the main objective here is to see if we can use a multi-input model we&#39;ll leave the data as it is for now. . Multi-input model . The rest of the notebook will describe some experiments with using fastai to create a model which takes tabular and text data as an input. The aim here wasn&#39;t for me to create the best model but get my head around how to combine models. I heavily relied on some existing notebooks, kaggle writeup and forum posts on the fastai forums. . Tabular model . In the dataset above we start of with two columns of data which can be used as inputs for the model. The title is fairly obviously something which we can treat like other text inputs. The URL is a little less obvious. It could be treated as a text input but an alternative is to treat a URL as parts which each contain some information which could be useful for our model. . http://www.specialschool.org/ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12668398 http://www.monarchit.co.uk/ . Each part of the URL could be split into smaller parts . [&#39;http://www&#39;, &#39;darwincountry&#39;, &#39;org/&#39;] . Whether a url has &#39;.org&#39; or &#39;.uk&#39; or &#39;.com&#39; could be meaningful for predicting our categories (it might also not be meaningful). It also offers us a way of taking the URLs and composing it into a format which looks more tabular. . scheme url1 url3 url4 url5 . 20011 http | www | org | NaN | NaN | . 15825 http | www | com | NaN | NaN | . 6068 http | www | co | uk | NaN | . 16507 http | www | co | uk | NaN | . 9723 http | www | co | uk | NaN | . So far I&#39;ve only done this very crudely. I suspect tidying up this part of the data will help improve things. At this point though we have something which is a little more tabular looking we can pass to fastai.tabular learner. Now we have some &#39;categories&#39; rather than unique urls. . print(len(df.url3.unique())) print(len(df.url4.unique())) . 279 56 . How does this tabular model do? . Once some preprocessing of the url has been done we train a model using the tabular learner. I didn&#39;t do much to try to optimize this model. Tracking best f2 score we end up with: . Better model found at epoch 36 with f_beta value: 0.17531482875347137 and an accuracy of 0.334121 . How well does a text model do? . Next I tried training using the title field in a NLP model. I tried a few things here. . SentencePiece tokenization . By default fastai uses SpaCy to do tokenization with a few additional special tokens added by fastai. I wanted to see if using sentencePiece would work better for processing title fields. SentencePiece allows for various sub-word tokeinzation. This can be useful for agglutinative languages but could also be useful when you have a lot of out of vocabulary words in your corpus. I wanted to see if this also was useful for processing titles since these may contain domain specific terms. I only tried using SentencePiece with &#39;unigram&#39; tokenization. The best score I got for this was: . Better model found at epoch 1 with f_beta value: 0.21195338666439056. . Default SpaCy tokenization . I compared the above to using the default fastai tokenizer which uses SpaCy. In this case the default approach worked better. This is probably because we didn&#39;t have a large pre-trained model using the SentencePiece tokenization to use as a starting point. The best score I got for this model was: . Better model found at epoch 27 with f_beta value: 0.33327043056488037. . Using the URL as text input . I wanted to do a quick comparison to the tabular model and use the URL as a text input instead. In this case I used SentencePiece with byte-pair-encoding (BPE). The best score in this case was: . Better model found at epoch 3 with f_beta value: 0.2568161189556122. . This might end up being a better approach compared to the tabular approach described above. . Combining inputs . Neither of these models is doing super well but my main question was whether combining the two would improve things at all. There are different approaches to combining these models. I followed existing examples and removed some layers from the text and tabular models which are then combined in a concat model. I won&#39;t cover all the steps here but all the notebooks can be found in this GitHub repo. . One of the things we need to do to create a model with multiple input is create a new Pytorch dataset which combines our text and tabular x inputs with our target. This is pretty straightforward: . class ConcatDataset(Dataset): def __init__(self, x1, x2, y): self.x1,self.x2,self.y = x1,x2,y def __len__(self): return len(self.y) def __getitem__(self, i): return (self.x1[i], self.x2[i]), self.y[i] . . One of the other pieces was creating a ConcatModel . class ConcatModel(nn.Module): def __init__(self, model_tab, model_nlp, layers, drops): super().__init__() self.model_tab = model_tab self.model_nlp = model_nlp lst_layers = [] activs = [nn.ReLU(inplace=True),] * (len(layers)-2) + [None] for n_in,n_out,p,actn in zip(layers[:-1], layers[1:], drops, activs): lst_layers += bn_drop_lin(n_in, n_out, p=p, actn=actn) # https://docs.fast.ai/layers.html#bn_drop_lin self.layers = nn.Sequential(*lst_layers) def forward(self, *x): x_tab = self.model_tab(*x[0]) x_nlp = self.model_nlp(x[1])[0] x = torch.cat([x_tab, x_nlp], dim=1) return self.layers(x) . . lst_layer is dependent on the layers from the tabular and nlp models. This layer is manually defined at the moment, so if changes are made to the number of layers in the tab model this needs to be manually changed. . bn_drop_lin is a fastai helper function that returns a a sequence of batch normalization, dropout and a linear layer which is the final layer of the model. . How does this combined model do? &#129335;&#8205;&#9794;&#65039; . The best result I got wasf_beta value: 0.39341238141059875 with an accuracy of 0.595348. A summary of the scores for each models: . Model F2 score . SentencePiece text | 0.211 | . Spacy text | 0.333 | . Tabular | 0.175 | . Concat | 0.393 | . This provides some improvement on the tabular or nlp models on their own. I found the combined model was fairly tricky to train and suspect that there could be some improvements in how the model is set up that might improve it&#39;s performance. I am keen to try a similar approach with a dataset where there is more abundant information available to train with. . tl;dr . It wasn&#39;t possible to get a very good f2 score on this website classification dataset. As the UK web archive say: . We expect that a appropriate classifier might require more information about each site in order to produce reliable results, and are looking at augmenting this dataset with further information in the future. Options include:For each site, make the titles of every page on that site available. For each site, extract a set of keywords that summarise the site, via the full-text index. . I suspect that having a either of these additional components would help improve the performance of the classifier. .",
