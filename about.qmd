Hi, I’m Daniel van Strien, a Machine Learning Librarian at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).

I started out in libraries and digital humanities, including time at the British Library on the [Living with Machines](https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/) project. I’ve also worked in academic libraries supporting open access and open science.

My work lives at the intersection of open-source technology, information management, and applied AI. Whether I’m building tools, writing tutorials, or contributing to community projects, I’m focused on making complex systems more usable, transparent, and inclusive.

At Hugging Face, I focus on the foundation of machine learning: data and datasets.
